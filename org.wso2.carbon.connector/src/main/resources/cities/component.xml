            <description>Returns Meetup cities. This method supports search by
                latitude/longitude/radius, by country/state, by query term/zip, or a combination of
                all of these. Location-only searches by lat and lon return all cities within a
                radius of the provided coordinates. Searches with a query return up to 10 cities
                matching the term, and can be sorted by size or distance to a given coordinate.
                'smart' ordering can be used to return the match(es) with the highest member_count,
                unless a smaller size match exists nearby the given coordinates. Query searches are
                supported for country but not country and state
